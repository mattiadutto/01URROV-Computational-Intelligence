# 18 / 01 / 2022
TODO: Compute discarded cards
~~TODO: Rename discardedCards -> discardPile~~

Implement this in MCTS
For the discard check that I have at least 1 used token. Add this in the MCTSN, already fix into suggestedMove(s) in @client.py, for MCTS I have to add that param. 

With a play no new note tokens.
Add the check that I have at least a token for do the hint. 
With a discard I receive back a token.

TO CHECK: What is happening when I try to hint myself.
